Breast cancer is a disease where abnormal breast cells grow uncontrollably, forming tumors. If untreated, these tumors can spread throughout the body and become fatal. The cancer cells typically start inside the milk ducts or lobules of the breast. The earliest stage, known as in situ, is not life-threatening and can be detected early. However, cancer can invade nearby breast tissue, forming tumors that cause lumps or thickening. Invasive cancers can spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs, a process known as metastasis, which can be life-threatening. Treatment varies based on the individual, the type of cancer, and its spread, typically involving a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and medications. 

In 2022, there were 2.3 million new breast cancer diagnoses and 670,000 deaths globally. Breast cancer can occur at any age after puberty but is more common in later life. There are significant disparities in breast cancer incidence and mortality based on a country's Human Development Index (HDI). In high-HDI countries, 1 in 12 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime, and 1 in 71 will die from it. In contrast, in low-HDI countries, 1 in 27 women will be diagnosed, and 1 in 48 will die from it. 

The primary risk factor for breast cancer is being female, with approximately 99% of cases occurring in women and 0.5-1% in men. Treatment for men follows the same principles as for women. The treatment approach depends on the cancer subtype and the extent of its spread, particularly to lymph nodes (stages II or III) or other body parts (stage IV). 

Doctors use a combination of treatments to reduce the risk of recurrence. These treatments include: 
  1. Surgery to remove the breast tumor 
  2. Radiation therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence in the breast and surrounding tissues 
  3. Medications, including hormonal therapies, chemotherapy, or targeted biological therapies 

Early detection and completion of treatment improve the effectiveness and tolerability of breast cancer treatments. So, our project focuses on radiation therapy for breast cancer.
